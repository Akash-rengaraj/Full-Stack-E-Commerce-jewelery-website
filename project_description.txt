## Project Overview

Sanjana Creations is a sophisticated, full-stack e-commerce application designed to provide a premium digital storefront for handcrafted jewelry. This project represents the intersection of artisanal elegance and modern web technology, delivering a seamless, visually immersive shopping experience for customers while offering powerful management tools for business owners.

At its core, the platform is built on a robust and scalable technology stack. The frontend leverages the power of **React** and **TypeScript**, orchestrated by **Vite** for lightning-fast performance and optimal developer experience. The user interface is meticulously styled using **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a responsive and bespoke design that adapts perfectly to any device.

The backend is powered by **Node.js** and **Express**, providing a secure and efficient RESTful API. It handles complex operations including user authentication (via **JWT** and **BCrypt**), product management, and order processing. The data is persisted using **MongoDB**, ensuring flexibility and speed in handling product catalogs and user data.
